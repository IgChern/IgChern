### Developer who transitioned from engineering

As a developer, I constantly strive to expand my skill set to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in information technology. I am ready for new challenges in the field of information technology.   

At the moment, my experience includes:

***Python***: I'm familiar with the Python language and have experience working with frameworks like Django and FastAPI. These tools allow me to develop high-performance web applications and APIs.  
***Databases***: I have experience working with PostgreSQL and using the SQLAlchemy library to interact with databases. I'm also familiar with Psycopg2, which enables me to work effectively with PostgreSQL from Python.  
***Web Development***: I have basic skills in HTML and CSS.  
***Version Control***: I actively use Git and GitHub Actions for version control of my projects.
